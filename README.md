# FileManager
A simple web app that authorize the users for different types of access over some files.

To start the server:
- source the virtual enviroment (source env/bin/activate)
- run with python the file main.py (python src/main.py)

N.B: to use the db in the folder "exampledb" you have to change the URI at line 15 
     of the src/main.py file to the desired new db location. 


for a list of calls you can check the API_DOC.txt
